Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Brandon, a full-time Engineering Lead @ [redacted] and part-time instructor at Vancouver Island University from Vancouver Island, Canada. I used to work on [Battlesnake](https://play.battlesnake.com) and I like to write things that interest me on my [website](https://brandonb.ca). I'm also very into amateur radio and the great outdoors.
